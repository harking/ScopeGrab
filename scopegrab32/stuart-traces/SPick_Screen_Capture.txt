Subject: Re: Flukeview V3 Demo?

Hi Jan,

It's me again. The format of the file is Epson Escape Sequence. You can use 
PrintCapture to import the file and it will reconstruct the image that 
FlukeView v1.1 creates. I should have known this...

I have attached the binary capture of the "QG129" command (by issuing it in 
a terminal and capturing the output).

In other words:
PC 19200,N,8,1,XONXOFF^$0D
<0^$0D>          (ACK)
QG129^$0D
<0^$0D>          (ACK)
<7453,>
<7453 bytes of ESC codes to follow........)

You need to strip off the first 7 bytes, this is the ACK from the scope. 
(ACK + 7453 bytes expected).

Hope this helps.

Regards,

Stuart
