Hi Jan,

It's me again. The format of the file is Epson Escape Sequence. You can use 
PrintCapture to import the file and it will reconstruct the image that 
FlukeView v1.1 creates. I should have known this...

I have attached the binary capture of the "QG129" command (by issuing it in 
a terminal and capturing the output).

In other words:
PC 19200,N,8,1,XONXOFF^$0D
<0^$0D>          (ACK)
QG129^$0D
<0^$0D>          (ACK)
<7453,>
<7453 bytes of ESC codes to follow........)

You need to strip off the first 7 bytes, this is the ACK from the scope. 
(ACK + 7453 bytes expected).

Hope this helps.

Regards,

Stuart
