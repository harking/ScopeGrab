<h1>Introduction</h1>
ScopeGrab32 v2.1 is a tool that allows you to download screenshots from your Fluke Scopemeter (SM). Depending on your SM model, it is also possible to download waveform data and store it into a CSV file ready for importing to e.g. Excel.<br>
<br>
To use this program, you'll need an optical link cable. Fluke currently sells their OC4USB USB adapter cable, and the serial optical cable PM9080 may also be available. You can easily build your own cable, too, which will work without problems in FlukeView also.<br>
<br>
SM models currently supported by ScopeGrab:
<ul>
 <li>SM190 and SM190C series (screenshots)
 <li>beta support: SM91, 92, 96, 97, 99 and SM123, SM124 (screenshots and for some, waveform download)
</ul>
<br>
ScopeGrab32 is free, open source, and GNU GPL. You can find the source code on <a href="http://scopegrab32.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">scopegrab32 home page</a> and the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/scopegrab32/" target="_blank"> scopegrab32 Sourceforge project page</a>.<br>
