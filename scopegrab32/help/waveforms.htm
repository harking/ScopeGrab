<h1>Waveform download</h1>
<u>Note:</u> there's no functional support yet for SM190(C) series waveform download! SM12x is untested. SM9x series waveforms are supported.<br>
<br>
After connecting, go to the "Waves and tools" tab, select a type of waveform to download, and click "Download". After a successful download, you're prompted for a file where to save the downloaded data. The file will be CSV formatted and can be directly imported into e.g. MS Excel. Additionally, a Matlab plotting string will be generated into the textbox, and will also be placed on the clipboard. You can paste the string into Matlab's command console (or maybe even into Octave) to create a graphical plot.<br>
