<h1><font face="Arial">Waveform download</font></h1>
<font face="Arial">
<u>Note:</u> there's no functional decoding support yet for SM190(C) series waveform download! SM12x is untested. 
Waveform data will be handled as raw hex data, you can try to manually decode... 
;-)<br>
<br>
SM9x series waveforms are fully supported.<br>
<br>
After connecting, go to the "Waves and tools" tab, select a type of waveform to download, and click "Download". After a successful download, you're prompted for a file where to save the downloaded data. The file will be CSV formatted and can be directly imported into e.g. MS Excel. Additionally, a Matlab plotting string will be generated into the textbox. 
The same string will also be placed on the clipboard. You can paste this&nbsp; string into Matlab's command console (or maybe even into Octave) to create a graphical plot.<br>
