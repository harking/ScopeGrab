 How to compile ScopeGrab32
---------------------------------

As always, meeting the software requirements here is
the easy part. While theoretically everything should
compile fine already on the first try, more probably
you are going to get some strange compiler errors...
:-) Then you should check in Dev-C++ Project Options
that all include and library paths are correct. In
Linux you'd have to edit the 'makefile'.

*** Windows ***

Install Dev-C++ 4.9.92 beta
  http://www.bloodshed.net/dev/devcpp.html
and get wxWindows (wxWidgets) 2.4.2 as a DevPak
for Dev-C++ from
  http://michel.weinachter.free.fr/
or www.google.com "wxwindows 2.4.2 devpak"

*** Linux ***

This source should compile fine if you have installed
the usual GNU compiler tools gcc, g++ and make.

As ScopeGrab32 uses wxWidgets, you'll additionally need
to download and compile the wxWidgets wxGTK source code.
You can download it at:
  http://www.wxwidgets.org/
If you want to redistribute a self-made binary of
ScopeGrab32, then you should compile wxWidgets with
  ./configure --disable-shared
  make
  make install

NOTE: use wxWidgets for wxGTK, version 2.4.2 or 2.6.2

The wxX11 and wxUniversal are simply way too buggy and
limited in the GUI department (e.g. no wxMessageBox...)

To compile ScopeGrab32, simply do
  make
in the source code folder. You can copy ScopeGrab32.bin
and the ./help folder to where ever you like, e.g. /usr/bin

I've tested that ScopeGrab32 works fine in SuSE 9.3
kernel 2.6 and GTK2+. I can not make any guarantees for
other distros, Mac OS X, Unix, or other systems. And
as usual with GNU GPL, no guarantees for anything.

If you find bugs or problems, just drop me an email.
